## Scheduling Algorithms included
- FCFS
- SJF
- SRTF
- Non-Pre-Emptive Priority
- Pre-Emptive Priority
- Round Robin
## Usage
- just compile and run boi

**P.S To change the algorithm used, change the last line of the main method. For example:<br><br>**
To run Round Robin:<br>
`gantChart.roundRobin(processes, 5); //5 is the quantum number`
<br><br>
To run First Come First Serve:<br>
`gantChart.firstComeFirstServe(processes);`
